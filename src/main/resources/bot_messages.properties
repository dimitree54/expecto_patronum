Platform rules:
registration_license_1=1. Be polite to other users.
registration_license_2=2. Do not break local law while using that platform. The platform purpose is to connect people based on their interest to let them chat with each other.\n\
 a. The choice of users to connect based on their posts (Wishes). Posts created by users and the platform is not responsible for its content. If you find it illegal or offensive you can:\n\
  - Accept that offensive task and report it by the platform tools. In that case rating of the post author will be damaged and the author will be added to your black list, so their content won't bother you anymore.\n\
  - Accept that offensive task and report its author by Telegram internal tools. For example, long tap on any message from that author -> Report. Please, do not report that way messages from the platform, that may corrupt its stability.\n\
  - If you think the post author breaks the law, you should accept the task (to stop its spreading among other users) and report to authorities. Also, you can report about the accident to the developers, so they can remove the post and block user.\n\
 b. Besides the posts, you may be exposed by offensive or illegal content after accepting some task in private chat. In that case you can also use advice from above. The platform and its developers have no access to messages in that discussion rooms, and thus are not responsible for its content.

 b. That includes your approximate geo-position that you provide. Other users won't see your precise position, but will be aware that "Wish-receiving" area specified by you intersect with "Wish-providing" area specified by other users. To make it harder to track your exact location for other users, as well as the platform developers, we add noise to your location before writing it to the database. That noise amplitude equal to 10% of radius of your location, so to be better hidden you can specify larger radius. You will be able to reveal your exact location yourself after matching with other user in discussion room.\n\
 c. Your Telegram contacts won't be revealed before somebody accept your wish post for fulfillment. When that happens, you both will be invited to special discussion room, so your contact secrecy will be revealed to that person, so they can write you private messages.

Some of them may be granted to access that database. It may happen that some of that developers is not trustworthy and that data leak. The leakage may happen due to hacker attacks as well. You agree, that your data stored in the database is not secret, and in case of any leakage, won't do any charges against the platform developers.

You agree that these messages will be considered as desirable, and you won't report it as spam.

registration_license_6=6.
