\n\
Platform rules:
registration_license_1=1. Be polite to other users.
registration_license_2=2. Do not break local laws while using the platform. The platform purpose is to connect people based on their interest to let them chat with each other.\n\
 a. The choice of users to connect is based on their posts (Wishes). Posts are created by users and the platform is not responsible for their content. If you find one of the posts illegal or offensive you can:\n\
  - Accept this offensive task and report it by the platform tools. In that case the rating of the author of the post will be damaged and the author will be added to your black list, so their content won't bother you anymore.\n\
  - Accept this offensive task and report its author by Telegram internal tools. For example, long tap on any message from this author -> Report. Please, do not report messages from the platform this way, it may corrupt its stability.\n\
  - If you think the author of the post breaks the law, you should accept the task (to stop it from spreading among other users) and report to authorities. Also, you can report the accident to the developers, so they can remove the post and block the user.\n\
 b. Besides the posts, you may be exposed by offensive or illegal content after accepting a task, in the private chat. In that case you can also use advice from above. The platform and its developers have no access to the messages in those discussion rooms, and thus are not responsible for their content.
registration_license_3=3. By accepting these rules, you agree, that all information you provide in your wish post may be visible to all other users.\n\
 a. This includes all textual and graphical content you include in the post.\n\
 b. This includes your approximate geoposition which you provide. Other users won't see your precise position, but will be aware that "Wish-receiving" area specified by you intersect with "Wish-providing" area specified by other users. To make it harder to track your exact location for other users, as well as the platform developers, we add noise to your location before writing it to the database. This noise amplitude is equal to 10% of the radius of your location, so in order to be better hidden you can specify the larger radius. You will be able to reveal your exact location yourself after matching with another user in the discussion room.\n\
 c. Your Telegram username won't be revealed before somebody accepts your wish post for fulfillment. When it happens, you both will be invited to a special discussion room, and your username secrecy will be revealed to this person, so they can write you private messages.
registration_license_4=4. You agree that the content of your messages (described above, including your geoposition and Telegram id) as well as your statistics of platform usage will be stored in the database on mongodb.net server. The developers of the platform will do their best to keep it safe. But note, that the application is open source and developed by an unlimited developers community. Some of them may be granted the access to the database. It may happen that some of the developers are not trustworthy and that the data leaks. The leakage may happen due to hacker attacks as well. You agree, that your data stored in the database is not secret, and in case of any leakage, won't do any charges against the platform developers.
registration_license_5=5. You agree that the following bots may write messages to you: @ExpectoPatronumByYID_bot, @ExpectoPatronumObserving_bot. You agree that these messages will be considered as desirable, and you won't report them as spam. Also, you agree that the following account may invite you to discussion groups, and you won't report these invitations as spam: @ExpectoPatronumHotel.
registration_license_6=6. Your wish posts will be recommended to other users based on their content (for example, geoposition) and your rating on the platform (the higher the rating, the more probable to be recommended). The rating increases when you fulfill other users' wishes and decreases when you create wishes, cancel them or when you are being reported.
